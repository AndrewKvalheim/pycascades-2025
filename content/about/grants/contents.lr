## About our grants program

Our grants program is an important tool that helps us realize a goal of creating an inclusive, respectful conference that welcomes people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientations. We provide financial assistance so people who might otherwise not be able to afford to join our event can.

Grants recipients for in-person tickets can have some part of their expenses (which can include travel, hotel, registration, and childcare) paid from PyCascadesâ€™s budget. Remote attendee grant recipients can have their ticket price covered and speakers can have AV needs paid for. We actively encourage people to apply for these grants. We actively encourage people to apply for these grants. Just as in previous years, we are dedicating a large portion of our budget to grants.

Our grants program prioritizes people with relatively low income, speakers, sprint coordinators, active builders of Python community, and notable open source contributors. However, anyone who would be financially burdened by attending PyCascades is welcome to apply.
